# edge-react-gui

## 1.12.1 (2020-04-17)

- ***BREAKING CHANGE*** Upgrade edge-core-js to v0.17.0
  - This release also renames all `pluginName` instances to `pluginId`. This affects all plugin types, but the core contains compatibility code so old currency plugins continue working (but not for rate or swap plugins, which are easier to just upgrade).
  - Breaking changes to the swap API:
    - Return a new `EdgeSwapResult` structure from `EdgeSwapQuote.approve`. This now contains the `destinationAddress` and `orderId` that used to exist on the `EdgeSwapQuote` type.
    - Merge the `EdgeSwapPluginQuote` and `EdgeSwapQuote` types into one.
      - The `EdgeSwapQuote.isEstimate` flag is no longer optional, but must be `true` or `false`.
      - Remove `EdgeSwapQuote.quoteUri`. Just concatenate `EdgeSwapInfo.orderUri` with `EdgeSwapResult.orderId` to get this.
    - Rename `EdgeSwapInfo.quoteUri` to `orderUri`.
    - Remove the deprecated `plugins` option from `EdgeSwapRequestOptions`.
  - Other breaking changes:
    - Remove deprecated `EdgeAccount.currencyTools`. Use `EdgeAccount.currencyConfig`.
    - Remove deprecated `EdgeAccount.exchangeTools`. Use `EdgeAccount.swapConfig`.
    - Remove deprecated `EdgeAccount.getExchangeQuote`. Use `EdgeAccount.fetchSwapQuote`.
    - Remove deprecated `EdgeAccount.pluginData`. Use `EdgeAccount.dataStore`.
    - Remove deprecated `EdgeIo.WebSocket`.
